    <dt class="col-sm-3">Look at</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9">The robot moves away from its current location to point its camera at the desired location. After viewing that location for a few seconds, the robot returns to looking at its original location.</dd>

    <dt class="col-sm-3">Update robot's location belief to</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9">The robot maintains a belief of where in the room it is. If you think it is mistaken in its belief, you may update it by taking this action.</dd>

    <dt class="col-sm-3">Pick up</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9">If the robot recognizes an object and its gripper is empty, then it can be directed to pick up the object.</dd>

    <dt class="col-sm-3">Stow object in gripper</dt>
    <dd class="col-sm-9">If there is an object in the robot's gripper, it can be directed to stow that object on its base. This might involve background arm motion that is not visible in the robot's camera.</dd>
